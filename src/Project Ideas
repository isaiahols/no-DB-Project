ideas: 
* used photos from NASA to show the photos of the day for any given day in the past
* get the weather for any zipcode or postal code 
* make site where you create a playlist. get music from an api (or at least names of music)
    - at the top of the page have a name (or option to play) new song that you can add to your play list and rate them
    - the bottom section of the page will have your playlist where you can delete songs, or edit ratings. 



REQUIRED - One stateful component, not counting App.js
A stateful component is defined with class extends Component and must contain state. The state must be modified somewhere.

REQUIRED - One stateless functional component
A stateless functional component, or an SFC, is simply a function. Learn more here --> https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html

REQUIRED - One GET endpoint in Express
A GET endpoint should return some data that you show on your website.

REQUIRED - One endpoint that uses req.body
To use req.body, you'll need a POST, PUT, or PATCH. If you use another HTTP verb, get it approved by your mentor first.



Each component above minimum
Define and use multiple components!
4.0 pts
Two additional components

Use a single component more than once
This means if you define e.g. an <Icon> component, you rendered it in 2+ places in the website. You would receive 2 points for 2+ uses of <Icon>. If you also defined e.g. <ListItem> and rendered it 2+ times, you would receive another 2 points, for a total of the maximum 4 points. A good place to render ListItem components would be in a loop or .map().

Two query parameters

External web API, per endpoint used
API is a broad term, but we mean web requests using axios or similar. The simplest definition is axios is needed to obtain/mutate data. You get 2 points per endpoint. You could do different requests from a single API (not counting URL or query string parameters), or one or more requests from multiple APIs.
